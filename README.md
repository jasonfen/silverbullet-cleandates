# silverbullet-cleandates
A space-script which strips a date string out of a URL of a note in the excellent PKM SilverBullet
## Goal
SilverBullet has built-in functions for readinig a page's creation date and name, however, for my purposes, I need to track the name of the page as it's entry date, with the purposes of creating a nav bar at the top of my journal template, linking to the day before and after that page.
